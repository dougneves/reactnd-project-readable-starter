This is my implementation of the second project for React Udacity Nanodegree

## Execute Project

To get started right away, clone the master branch and:

* Install and start the API server
  * `cd api-server`
  * `npm install`
  * `node server`
* In another terminal window, do the same in the frontend folder
  * `cd frontend`
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
